1-20-23 update repo to include "Stochastic RSI & TTM Multi-timeframe v3.2 - Chapo Tendie"

The intention of this indicator is for it to be used on a multichart window as a standalone indicator on the 1 min timeframe, and used to signal profitable opportunties 

A multitimeframe indicator was developed to chart momentum, volatility, and a stochastic oscillator on a single chart through colored squares across various time frames. Standard time frame ranges were employed for momentum and squeeze indicators, and a meticulous selection process was applied to determine optimal time frames for stochastic analysis. The indicator monitors multiple time frames simultaneously, updating every minute.

Instances of red or green signals on the stochastic oscillator across any time frame are interpreted as potential trade opportunities. Traders can set alerts on TradingView to receive notifications on PCs and phones, prompting further investigation on a primary chart.

The strategy recognizes that smaller time frames may exhibit more oscillatory movements, making them suitable for reversal trades when stochastic values reach extremes. Larger time frames, with tendencies to trend, are considered for trend trades when stochastic values signal directional movements.


IMPORTANT NOTE:
-> The timeframe for this indicator must be set at 1 minute;
-> If the chart timeframe is higher than 1 minute, the results shown in the table for timeframes lower than the chart will not be correct;
-> Tradingview's own documentation explains this as follows: "It is not recommended to request data of a timeframe lower that the current chart timeframe, for example 1 minute data from a 5 minutes chart. The main problem with such a case is that some part of a 1 minute data will be inevitably lost, as itâ€™s impossible to display it on a 5 minutes chart and not to break the time axis. In such cases the behavior of security can be rather unexpected"; and
-> It is therefore recommended that this indicator is placed in a standalone 1min chart window, and the window resized to only show the table to avoid any issues.
